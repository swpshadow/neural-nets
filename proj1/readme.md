csgo.ipynb is the code for the high accuracy model created previous to this course. The code has feature extraction that is not used such as seperating out what primary and secondary guns the players have and all of the players' coordinate history. That info is mostly white noise and can decrease accuracy. 

naive bayes is my half of the homework for the class where I implement a naive bayes classifier for the csgo data. 

Sadly, I cannot include any of the datasets on this repo as the data is not mine to share.
